                <h4 class="text-center">Development</h4>
                <p><strong>We've got the coding chops.</strong> At the heart of every project is quality code that
                    makes it all run.</p>
                <p>We mitigate risk by prototyping the most challenging pieces first in order to efficiently
                    manage budgets and timelines. Our code is crafted in an iterative process with alphas and betas for
                    our clients to track progress.</p>
